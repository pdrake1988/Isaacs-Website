        <p>GameStop is finally showing signs of life, and it’s all because someone is buying up their stock. A company that most people have written off more or less for dead suddenly sees its stock price skyrocket by nearly 180% in a matter of five days – what could this mean? Maybe there’s hope after all. GameStop has been around since the pre-internet era when you had to go out into real stores with video games instead of downloading them online onto your console through PSN store & Xbox Games Store; nobody thought they’d come back anytime soon but now. God knows why anyone would want these things when everything else can just download straight from the manufacturer.</p>
        <p>GameStop’s stock has been on a wild ride this year. The company is soaking up profits in anticipation of some serious losses, but it could also mean big things if you’re looking to invest your money wisely.
          The story behind how they got here? Well, that would be interesting too. But first, let me tell you all about my favorite part. These market mechanics are nothing without savvy investors who know what drives prices up or down based on certain events happening within each industry. There are all sorts of crazy doctoring going around.</p>
        <p>So, What Now?</p>
        <p>Buying stock in a company is like gambling, but instead of betting on horses, you’re investing your money into one industry. If the market perceives that there will be growth for this particular firm, then their shares might go up, and if they think things are going south with another investor could buy back some at a lower cost than what it was sold to. But when someone borrows a specific amount (the number varies) from an exchange where he/she sells goods against these bonds as soon as possible before returning them; however, its price has gone down since last time, which makes him even richer by being able to buy those same assets cheaper.</p>
        <p>GameStop is running out of extra lives, its batteries are dying, and it has parents telling it to go sleep because school starts in the morning.
          The video game retailer with over 7500 stores worldwide still holds on thanks largely due to their business selling used games that cannot be downloaded like some other digital titles can these days but also high demand for new PlayStation 5s from rival Sony alongside Xbox One S/X consoles that have been selling well leading up until November 12th, 2019 when Microsoft took preorders offline without warning causing chaos among fans who ordered early or bought at retail before then as there will only ever be 500k made available globally while supplies last once they finally arrive not including Japan where 100 thousand units were released alongside China.
          GameStop has been in and out of the news because many people believe they will go bankrupt. The company is currently making money, but short-sellers are betting that it won’t last long enough for them to profit from their trades on stock market prices going down due to fears about Game Stop’s stability which some consider inevitable given recent events like layoffs, among other things.</p>
        <p>Should You Invest?</p>
        <p>Investors seem to be forgetting about the news as it happens, which is often how these things go. GameStop’s stock price has been rollercoasters this year due in part to wild trading on memes and other companies’ potentially disruptive announcements, so investors will likely forget what they read by next week, at least until something new pops up again.
